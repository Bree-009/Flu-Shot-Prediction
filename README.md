# Predicting Flu-Shot Vaccine Uptake

## Introduction

In 2009, the World Health Organization (W.H.O) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic. That year, the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. The pandemic was declared over but the H1N1 flu strain became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu. 

Seasonal flu (influenza) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in all parts of the world. Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat and a runny nose. 
In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly; [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/influenza-seasonal#tab=tab_1).


Most people with the flu get better on their own. But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk like the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, health workers and those with serious medical conditions. The seasonal flu vaccine can now help protect against the H1N1 flu and other seasonal flu viruses; [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swine-flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20378103#:~:text=Overview,infect%20pigs%2C%20birds%20and%20humans.).


## Problem Statement

**What is the prevailing circumstance?**

Immunization is a global health and development success story, saving millions of lives every year. Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with the bodyâ€™s natural defences to build protection; [W.H.O](https://www.who.int/health-topics/vaccines-and-immunization#tab=tab_1). 


**What problem are we trying to solve?**

Despite the benefits of vaccines, many people are still reluctant to get vaccines or vaccinate their children. According to the [National Center for BioTechnology Information](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4869767/#:~:text=Some%20parents%20believe%20that%20the,the%20benefits%20of%20the%20vaccines.), the reasons for vaccine hesitancy can be divided into 4 categories: religious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from healthcare providers. 


**How the project aims to solve the problem?**

This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting vaccine uptake by analyzing an individual's background information and behavioral patterns.
Understanding the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy will better enable healthcare personnel to provide the education and awareness that individuals need to make responsible immunization choices.
