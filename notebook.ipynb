    "In 2009, the World Health Organization (W.H.O) declared the H1N1 flu to be a pandemic. That year, the virus caused an estimated 284,400 deaths worldwide. The pandemic was declared over but the H1N1 flu strain became one of the strains that cause seasonal flu. \n",

    "Seasonal flu (influenza) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses which circulate in all parts of the world. Seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat and a runny nose. \n",
    "In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly; [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/influenza-seasonal#tab=tab_1).\n",

    "Most people with the flu get better on their own. But flu and its complications can be deadly, especially for people at high risk like the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, health workers and those with serious medical conditions.
